# minir
minir is a libretro frontend intended to complement RetroArch, by focusing on the usecases RetroArch is not focused on. In the unlikely event that RetroArch catches up to minir on all meaningful features, minir will be declared obsolute.

 | RetroArch | minir
----- | ----- | ------
Prefered setup | HTPC in fullscreen; many others supported | Desktop computers, windowed mode
Input method | Preferably a controller (DualShock, Xbox, etc); use with keyboard and mouse is awkward | Keyboard and mouse, controllers not supported (yet)
Menus | Custom | System native
Core support | Full (limited by system hardware) | Limited (currently)
Automatic core selection | ? (it's been mentioned) | Yes
Major features | Real-time rewind, Dynamic Rate Control, user-defined shaders, netplay, low-latency fullscreen, ... | Real-time rewind, maximally configurable hotkeys, (more to come)
(Note that this table is based on the minir author's views; the RetroArch authors' views may differ.)

List of features (including unimplemented ones) where the idea is from RetroArch:
- libretro itself, of course
- Dynamic Rate Control (unimplemented)
- Real-time rewind
- Rewind-based netplay (unimplemented)
- Custom shaders (unfinished)
