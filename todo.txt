* = currently working on

major:
- various parts need to become proper C++
 - more strings
- main.cpp is a mess, global variables all over
- finish shader support
 - finish Cg to GLSL compiler
 - add multipass
 - add custom textures
 - add imports
 - add parameters
* rewrite input
 - more C++ in inputmapper and libretroinput
  - libretroinput needs massive expansion, or merging into libretro
   - struct libretro is messy anyways - needs to be handled more cleanly, I only want one load function.
 * more input options
  * mouse support
   * needed features:
    - view position relative to window
     - inputmouse or put that in widget_viewport?
    - bind a mouse, removing its cursor and sending relative data to minir instead
    * find how to implement that
   - automatic mouse control for scrolling shooters
  - controller support, if I can get my hands on any
  - tablets and other bizarre input devices?
- netplay
 - need both RetroArch-style rewind and laggy
  - and selecting the right amount of each
- rewrite audio
 - C++
 - RetroArch-style Dynamic Rate Control
 - thread it
- video recording
 - record to ffmpeg
 - record to GIF
- rewrite config handler again
 - it's currently fairly leaky
 - will need to rewrite minir.cfg.tmpl, in a new format that can be turned into a GUI
  - still want the union with config.video_scale/etc, though
   - now that c++ is used, strings (including input) can be turned into some kind of memory managing class - far easier
 - get rid of the compressed bytecode, can be optimized later
  - don't do it
  - don't do it yet
 - tie core options to input sources, for layer toggle in snes9x

minor:
- (win32) dropping a file into the window segfaults - but only with debugger disabled
 - does this still exist?

incomprehensible:
- figure out the Mupen64 issues
- why is Windows OpenGL 48fps?
