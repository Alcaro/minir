current:
- finish c++ rewrite
- finish rewriting inputraw to inputkb, then rename it back because we probably don't want mixed input sources
- rewrite config handler again
 - it's currently fairly leaky
 - will need to rewrite minir.cfg.tmpl, in a new format that can be turned into a GUI
  - still want the union with config.video_scale/etc, though
   - now that c++ is used, strings (including input) can be turned into some kind of memory managing class - far easier
 - get rid of the compressed bytecode, can be optimized later
  - don't do it
  - don't do it yet
 - tie core options to input sources, for layer toggle in snes9x

bugs:
- (gtk+) starting without rom then opening one screws up window width due to status bar not resizing
 - can I get rid of the manual layout management there?
- (win32) dropping a file into the window segfaults - but only with debugger disabled

other:
- get gl cores working
- get shaders working
- get video recorder working
 - multiple video backends
  - ffmpeg
  - gif

- rewrite main.c (maybe do one part at the time?)

- figure out how to handle mice
 - controllers (only if I can get my hands on any)
 - tablets and other bizarre devices?

- rewrite audio:
 - dynamic rate control
 - move to another thread
