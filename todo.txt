* = currently working on

major:
- various parts need to become proper C++
 - more strings
- main.cpp is a mess, global variables all over
- finish shader support
 - finish Cg to GLSL compiler
 - add multipass
 - add custom textures
 - add imports
 - add parameters
* rewrite input
 - C++
 * more input options
  * mouse support
   * automatic mouse control for scrolling shooters
  - controller support, if I can get my hands on any
  - tablets and other bizarre input devices?
- netplay
 - need both RetroArch rewind and laggy
- rewrite audio
 - C++
 - RetroArch-style Dynamic Rate Control
 - thread it
- video recording
 - record to ffmpeg
 - record to GIF
- rewrite config handler again
 - it's currently fairly leaky
 - will need to rewrite minir.cfg.tmpl, in a new format that can be turned into a GUI
  - still want the union with config.video_scale/etc, though
   - now that c++ is used, strings (including input) can be turned into some kind of memory managing class - far easier
 - get rid of the compressed bytecode, can be optimized later
  - don't do it
  - don't do it yet
 - tie core options to input sources, for layer toggle in snes9x

minor:
- (gtk+) starting without rom then opening one screws up window width due to status bar not resizing
 - can I get rid of the manual layout management there?
- (win32) dropping a file into the window segfaults - but only with debugger disabled

incomprehensible:
- figure out the Mupen64 issues
- why is Windows OpenGL 48fps?
